# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual guide that represents the structure and layout of a web page or app. It focuses on how content and functionality will appear on the screen without worrying about colors, images, or detailed styling.

## Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing helps designers and developers:
- Plan the layout and structure of a product before development begins.
- Identify potential usability issues early in the process.
- Communicate ideas clearly with stakeholders and team members.
- Save time and effort by catching problems before coding starts.
